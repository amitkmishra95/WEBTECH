  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been a topic of interest for decades, but in recent years, it has experienced a significant boom. <br>
  <p>This surge in AI development can be attributed to the availability of large amounts of data, advancements in computing power, and  <br>
    the rise of machine learning algorithms. Today, AI is being applied in various industries, including healthcare, finance, transportation, <br>
     and education, to name a few. The boom in AI has also led to the creation of new job opportunities, with roles such as AI engineer, data <br>
     scientist, and machine learning engineer becoming increasingly popular. However, the rapid growth of AI also raises concerns about job <br>
     displacement, bias in decision-making, and the need for ethical considerations in AI development. Despite these challenges, the boom in  <br>
     AI is expected to continue, with experts predicting that AI will become an integral part of our daily lives in the near future.</p>
